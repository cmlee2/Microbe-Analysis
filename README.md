# belly-button-challenge

Purpose of this project was to build an interative dashboard to explore a dataset that catalogs the microbes within the human navel.

Assistance was gathered from AskBCS for help regarding dropdown menu and using filter functions.

        names.forEach(name => {DropdownMenu
            .append("option")
            .text(name)
            .property("value", name)
            
        });



let sampleValue = samples.filter(result => result.id ==sample)
